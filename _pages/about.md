This is **Zhanxiong Ma**, an Associate Professor at the College of Civil Engineering and Mechanics, Lanzhou University. I received my B.S. and M.S. degrees from Huazhong University of Science and Technology and Chongqing University, respectively, and my Ph.D. degree from the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), where I studied under the supervision of Prof. Hoon Sohn. Before joining Lanzhou University, I worked as a postdoctoral researcher at the Applied Science Institute, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology. My research interests lie in the field of structural health monitoring, with a focus on intelligent structural monitoring and high-precision displacement measurement.
